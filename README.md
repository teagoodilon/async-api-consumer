# 📱 Welcome to my Async Consumer Api 📩
This is my third challenge made during the scholarship period at Compass.UOL. It is basically an api that takes the post data and merges it with the comments from the test api https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ where the whole process is done asynchronously using a pipeline scheme for each post status. 

## Technologies Used 
- ☕ Java 17.0.7 - [Java 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html)
- 💽 Maven 17 - [Maven](https://maven.apache.org)
- 🍃 Spring Boot - [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
- 🚀 Postman - [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
- 📊 VisualVM - [VisualVM](https://visualvm.github.io/)
- 💻 Intellij - [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/))
- 🏦 H2 - [H2 Database](https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html)

## How to run the Project 
1. Clone the project:
```
git clone https://github.com/teagoodilon/async-api-consumer.git
```
2. And run the project on Intellij IDE! ✅

## Challenges faced

The initial difficulty was the lack of understanding of the resolution that we should propose in the code, but after a meeting with the instructor, things became clearer. After that, when I understood the dimension of the problem, I was not quite sure where to begin, so I started the way I thought was most correct and later applied the functions that were requested.

## Express my thanks
I am extremely grateful to Compass.UOL for the great learning experience in this third challenge and all the support I received. I look forward to the next ones! 😆
